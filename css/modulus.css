/*   Welcome to the Modulus GravCMS theme!
**
**  The theme plays with using modular pages in Grav, and even alows hacks like moduls having submodules (think of it as two layers of modular pages)
**
**  Components: are Single items that can be used on the page, such as a module, navigation and so on.
**  Themes: are a set of variable overides to change the look of the site or component (aka so different sites have their own colors and styles)
